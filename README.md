# Retake-Project: Inventory Management with Low-Stock Alerts

The project aims to build a small-scale inventory tracking system for a retail shop. The system will store product details, track stock levels in real-time, record sales transactions, and automatically alert the user when stock drops below a defined threshold. It will also provide basic analytics such as total sales revenue and profit margins. The data that will be used for this project, will be the one entered by the user through the User Interface.
Key Components
1.	Product Management (CRUD):  Add, edit, delete, and view product records).
2.	Stock Transactions: Increase or decrease stock quantities through purchase orders or sales.
3.	Automatic Low-Stock Alerts: Detect when stock falls below a threshold and display alerts in the UI.
4.	Sales Tracking & Revenue Calculation: Record sales data, compute total revenue and profit margins.
5.	Inventory Sorting & Filtering: Sort products by stock level, sales quantity, or profit margin.
