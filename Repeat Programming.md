# Welcome to the Learning Outcomes Evaluation

Dear student,

Welcome to this Learning Outcomes Evaluation session. The goal is to assess your understanding and mastery of the learning outcomes for this semester as evidenced by your work that was submitted on your personal git account. Remember to answer each question thoroughly by referencing **Java** code and provide clear explanations where necessary.

Best regards,
Kay Berkling

## Checklist before handing in your work

* [ ] Review the assignment requirements to ensure you have completed all the necessary tasks.
* [ ] Double-check your links and make sure that links lead to where you intended. Each answer should have links to work done by you in your own git repository. 
* [ ] Make sure you have at least 10 references to your project code (This is important evidence to prove that your project is substantial enough to support the learning outcome of object oriented design and coding within a larger piece of code.)
* [ ] Include comments to explain your referenced code and why it supports the learning outcome.
* [ ] Commit and push this markup file to your personal git repository and hand in the link and a soft-copy via email at the end of the designated time period.

Remember, this checklist is not exhaustive, but it should help you ensure that your work is complete, well-structured, and meets the required standards.

Good luck with your evaluation!

# Project (70%)

## Description (overall vision of the project)

*My project consist of implementing an inventory system for a retail shop, where the user/administrator can apply the CRUD operations, sale product, track sale transactions, revenues and also benefit. Additionally, the use could filter their product display using a dropdown menu.*

## Link to your GIT Project

*https://github.com/Roiczone/Retake-Project*

## TECH STACK

*Frontend/UI: JvaFx
Backend: Java
Database: Sqlite using JDBC
Architecture: Data Access Object*


## What did you achieve? (list each of the functionalities)

*in the cost of implementing this project, I was able to achieve the following:
A full functional inventory system, a good user interface, database accessing and connection and also error handling and validation*


## Pick 3 of the functionalities
#### for each of the 3 functionalities link to the class that is responsible for it and explain the role of this and other classes in combination to fulfill the functionality

### 1
*CRUD operations*

### 2
*Database connection*

### 3
*Data Object Accessing
In order to easilly access to the object stored in my database, I implement 2 classes, one was the ProductDAO which holds the ways in which I use to access the objects and the secont one ProductDAOImpl where all the accessing methos where implemented.*

## Evaluation Questions

Please answer the following questions to the best of your ability to show your understanding of the learning outcomes. Please provide examples from your project code to support your answers.


## Evaluation Material
All questions require an explanation and a link to your project on git. 

### Q1. Algorithms

Algorithms are manifold and Java can be used to program these. Examples are sorting or search strategies but also mathematical calculations. Please refer to **two** areas within your project with a link, where you have coded an algorithm. Do not make reference to code written for other classes, like theoretical informatics. Explain the algorithm.
